## THEORY:
Servo Motor Theory There are some special types of applications of an electric
motor where the rotation of the motor is required for just a certain angle. For these
applications, we require some special types of motor with some special arrangement
which makes the motor rotate a certain angle for a given electrical input (signal). For
this purpose, servo motor comes into the picture.
The servo motor is usually a simple DC motor controlled for specific angular rotation
with the help of additional servomechanism (a typical closed-loop feedback control
system). Nowadays, servo systems are used widely in industrial applications.
Servo motor applications are also commonly seen in remote-controlled toy cars for
controlling the direction of motion, and it is also very widely used as the motor which
moves the tray of a CD or DVD player. Besides these, there are hundreds of servo
motor applications we see in our daily life.
The main reason behind using a servo is that it provides angular precision, i.e. it will
only rotate as much we want and then stop and wait for the next signal to take
further action. The servo motor is unlike a standard electric motor which starts
turning as when we apply power to it, and the rotation continues until we switch off
the power. We cannot control the rotational progress of electrical motor, but we can
only control the speed of rotation and can turn it ON and OFF. Small servo motors
are included many beginner Arduino starter kits, as they are easy to operate as part
of a small electronics projects.

## PROGRAM:
#include <Servo.h>
Servo myservo;
int pos = 0;
void setup()
{
myservo.attach(4);
}
void loop()
{
for(pos = 0; pos <= 180; pos += 1)
{
myservo.write(pos);
delay(15);
}
for(pos = 180; pos>=0; pos-=1)
{
myservo.write(pos);
delay(15);
}
}
